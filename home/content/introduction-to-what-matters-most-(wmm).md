## INTRODUCTION TO WHAT MATTERS MOST (WMM)

One of the study's objectives is to determine what matters most to individuals seeking well-being and their caregivers. The concept is to move beyond clinicians' views to focus on areas of interest to service users.

The study will explore ‘what matters most’ and narrow it down to specific examples, examining broad domains and then summarizing them with specific examples of what matters most. This is then ordered and prioritized.

Methods employed encourage group reflection, dynamic discussion, and an initial sense of priorities, highlighting common vital aspects. This will then lead to carefully worded questions/ items for a questionnaire.

The results of the administered questionnaire will be mapped to relevant psychosocial resources.
